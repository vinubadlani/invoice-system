# Deployment Guide for Vercel

## Fixed Issues
✅ TypeScript compilation errors resolved:
- Added missing `TrendingDown` import in `app/dashboard/page_new.tsx`
- Fixed type definition in `app/party/page_new.tsx` FormData state
- Fixed prop name from `configs` to `filters` in DataTableFilters component

✅ Invalid JSON in vercel.json resolved:
- Simplified vercel.json to use only essential configuration
- Removed complex settings that were causing JSON parsing errors

## Environment Variables Required

Make sure to set these environment variables in your Vercel project:

```bash
# Supabase Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key

# Next.js Configuration (for production)
NEXTAUTH_URL=https://your-app-name.vercel.app
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your_nextauth_secret_key

# Optional: Database direct connection (for migrations)
DATABASE_URL=your_database_connection_string
```

## Vercel Configuration

Your `vercel.json` has been simplified with essential settings:
```json
{
  "framework": "nextjs",
  "buildCommand": "npm run build",
  "installCommand": "npm install"
}
```

## Deployment Steps

1. **Push your code** to your GitHub repository
2. **Set environment variables** in Vercel dashboard
3. **Deploy** - Vercel will automatically build using the fixed configuration

## Note About Warnings

The build shows warnings about `viewport` metadata that should be moved to `viewport` export instead of `metadata` export. These are warnings, not errors, and won't prevent deployment. You can fix them later if needed.

## Build Success

The build now compiles successfully with:
- ✅ No TypeScript errors
- ✅ No JSON syntax errors in vercel.json
- ✅ Proper static generation
- ✅ Optimized bundle sizes
- ✅ All routes properly configured
